definitely good weather predicting

Next step is to make it a website using flask. Will do this by doing a few things
basically just turn the main.py into db.py where I connect to the database and also
into run.py where it will run the program and give the random guess


other stuff to consider:
adding in javascript to do permissions based predicting using the geolocation API
